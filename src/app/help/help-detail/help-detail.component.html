                    The term <i>Target</i> is synonymous with <i>Deep Sky Object</i> or <i>DSO</i> but less wordy and cryptic.
                    Targets comprise of one essential field: <i>Surface Brightness</i>. You can read more about <i>Surface Brightness</i>
                    in another section but just know that obtaining a proper value is an art form.

                    is less forgiving. It <b>must</b> know the value of <i>Surface Brightness</i> in order to proceed and because
                    of that it filters out invalid targets from its selection list.

                    Determining the value of <i>Surface Brightness</i> is an art form. I use these three reliable sources:

                    <a href="http://knightware.biz/" target="blank">Deep Sky Planner 7</a> directly offers Surface Brightness in units
                    compatible with our web application (i.e. <i>magnitudes per square arc-second</i>) but the software is Windows-only
                    and must be purchased.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.ap-i.net/skychart/en/start" target="blank">Cartes du Ciel (aka SkyChart)</a> also directly
                    offers Surface Brightness but the units are not compatible. It gives <i>magnitudes per square arc-minutes</i> versus
                    <i>arc-seconds</i>. You can use their value but only if you add 8.89 to it. Of course you can always use our
                    <i>Surface Brightness Calculator</i>. More on that in a later section. <i>Cartes du Ciel</i> is freeware planetarium
                    software and provides distributions for Linux, Mac, Raspberry Pi, as well as Windows.

                    offer Surface Brightness but it does give <i>Magnitude</i>, <i>Major Axis</i>, and <i>Minor Axis</i>. You can use
                    our built-in <i>Surface Brightness Calculator</i> to calculate it. <i>C2A</i> is Windows-only planetarium software.

                <p>
                    Now to the definition of <i>Surface Brightness</i>. Try to visualize a galaxy. The galaxy's core is the brightest,
                    followed by the arms, and then the elusive galactic halo. Now, imagine squeezing all of those photons from all areas
                    into a tiny area the size of a single star. (Technically the size is 1 square arc-second.) How bright
                    would it be? Surprisingly bright. The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) has a <i>magnitude</i> of 3.4 which would make it easily
                    visible from the center of most large cities but the fact of the matter is all of those photons are spread out over
                    a very large area, so because of that it is impossible to see M31 from New York City with the naked eye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the magnitude of M31 is 3.4 then what is its <i>Surface Brightness</i>? To answer that question we need to
                    know its dimensions. C2A lists it as 189.1 <i>arc-minutes</i> by 61.7 <i>arc-minutes</i>. Now let's plug those numbers into our
                    <i>Surface Brightness Calculator</i>. The answer is 22.2 <i>magnitudes per square arc-second</i>. Remember that this is the
                    <i>average</i> brightness over the entire area. Some parts will be brighter but overall it is a good
                    measure of how much effort it takes to obtain a world-class image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To explain why the Andromeda Galaxy is not visible without the aid of a telescope from New York City, consider that
                    the city's <i>Sky Brightness</i> is around 18 magnitudes per square arc-second. (We'll talk more about that in the
                    section on <i>Observatories</i>). Now compare 18 to 22.2. That makes the galaxy 4.2 magnitudes fainter than the sky.
                    I'm sorry but you are just not going to see it with the naked eye. You'll need a telescope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earlier I spoke of <i>Surface Brightness</i> determination as an art form. The problem is that different information
                    sources may give you significantly different values for magnitude, major axis, and minor axis depending on what
                    criteria they use. I have seen deviations of up to 2 magnitudes per square arc-second. This is huge. I recommend that
                    you choose a provider and stick with them. I've recommended three of them.

                    In case your information provider does not directly offer the value of <i>Surface Brightness</i> you can use this

                    giving the answer. Use your keyboard and mouse to copy the value and paste it into the <i>Surface Brightness</i> field
                    in your target. This copy-and-paste step is important. The calculated value will be lost when you hide the calculator.

                <p>
                    Magnitude is brightness measured on a logarithmic scale. Negative magnitude is very bright, the Sun is at -25 and the
                    Full Moon at -12. Sirius, the brightest star besides our Sun, is magnitude -1.6. At night in the suburbs the faintest
                    star you can see with the naked eye is around +5. With a small telescope and eyepiece you can see down to about +12.
                    With a small telescope and a camera you can capture stars down to +18. With a large telescope and camera in dark rural
                    skies you can see down to magnitude +25, give or take.

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    By convention the ellipse is used to model a target's shape. An ellipse can be described by two properties: major axis
                    and minor axis. It is similar in a way to a rectangle's width and height except that ellipses have curved edges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The units of measurement are angular, specifically arc-minutes. The Surface Brightness Calculator requires arc-minutes
                    so make sure that your information provider is giving you values in arc-minutes. Unless it is spelled out a single
                    apostrophe denotes arc-minutes whereas a double apostrophe, better known as quote marks, denotes arc-seconds. Galaxies
                    are almost always quoted in arc-minutes but a lot of planetary nebulae are in arc-seconds. Be sure to divide arc-seconds
                    by 60 in order to convert it to arc-minutes.

                    Telescopes come in all shapes and sizes but each falls into the category of either <i>Refractive</i> or <i>Reflective</i>.
                    Refractors use a lens as the primary light gathering element. Reflectors use a mirror.

                    There are four essential properties that describe a telescope. You can leave them empty and come back later to fill them in.
                    Just know that the <i>Calculate!</i> tool is less forgiving. It <b>must</b> know the value of each in order to proceed.
                    Any telescope with properties that are incomplete or have invalid values will be filtered out of its selection list.

                    This is the diameter of the primary lens or mirror measured in millimeters(mm). For example my William Optics refractor's
                    aperture is 71mm. Other telescopes may be measured in inches. In those cases multiply inches by 25.4. It's best to refer
                    to the manufacturer's datasheet for the exact value.

                    Focal length is measured in millimeters(mm). Basically it is the distance between the primary lens or mirror and the focused
                    image. Be careful to factor in the effect of addtional refractive elements like a focal reducer or barlow lens. If you added
                    a 0.67x focal reducer then multiply 0.67 by the manufacturer's datasheet for focal length. For example if the manufacturer says
                    that the telescope's focal length is 616mm then you need to multiply it by 0.67 to get the <i>effective</i> focal length of
                    412.7mm.

                    Almost all reflectors have a central obstruction of one type or the other. Usually there is a small <i>secondary mirror</i>
                    that reflects the light 90 degrees to an opening in the telescope tube. Please refer to your manufacturer's datasheet for
                    the size of the central obstruction. Note that refractors do not have one but you still need to enter 0.

                    This is a measure of the total optical efficiency of the telescope. Values from 0 to 1 are acceptable. A value of 1 is
                    <i>ideal</i> but in reality there are always some losses. If you have multiple elements like a primary and secondary mirror
                    then you need to multiply them. For example if the primary mirror is 99% efficient and the secondary is 98% efficient then
                    calculate 0.99 times 0.98. You should enter the value of 0.97 in this field. I recommend not fretting over the exact value.
                    I use 0.99.

                <p>
                    Pixel Size is measured in microns which is one-thousandth of a millimeter, abbreviated <i>um</i>. CMOS cameras generally have smaller
                    pixel sizes than do CCD cameras. 2 microns to 10 microns is not uncommon.

                <p>
                    Many cameras have square pixels but some have rectangular ones. Our <i>Pixel Size</i> property assumes a square pixel. If yours is
                    rectangular, say for example 3um x 4um, then you need to run a simple calculation: <i>SQRT(width * height)</i>. So in our example you
                    will calculate <i>SQRT(3 * 4)</i> which is 3.464. That is the value you should enter.

                    units of electrons (e-). Please refer to the manufacturer's datasheet. CMOS cameras generally have lower Read Noise than CCDs.

                    <i>Dark Current</i> is affected by the temperature of your camera's sensor. The higher the temperature the greater the current
                    and consequently the noise. In an ideal world our camera is unaffected by temperature but to get close to ideal we must cool the
                    sensor. Cameras that are designed for deep-sky astrophotography come with thermo-electric coolers that lower the sensor's
                    temperature by nearly 40 degrees Celsius. Dark current at that temperature is virtually zero. If your camera's manufacturer has
                    data on dark current then use it but if not feel free to enter zero in this field.

                    then it is said to have 100% <i>Quantum Efficiency</i>. Reality is a different story. Most cameras have far less than 100%
