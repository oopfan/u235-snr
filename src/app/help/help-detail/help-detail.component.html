                    The term <i>Target</i> is synonymous with <i>Deep Sky Object</i> or <i>DSO</i> but less wordy and cryptic.
                    Targets comprise of one essential field: <i>Surface Brightness</i>. You can read more about <i>Surface Brightness</i>
                    in another section but just know that obtaining a proper value is an art form.

                    Determining the value of <i>Surface Brightness</i> is an art form. I use these three reliable sources:

                <p>
                    <a href="http://knightware.biz/" target="blank">Deep Sky Planner 7</a> directly offers Surface Brightness in units
                    compatible with our web application (i.e. <i>magnitudes per square arc-second</i>) but the software is Windows-only
                    and must be purchased.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.ap-i.net/skychart/en/start" target="blank">Cartes du Ciel (aka SkyChart)</a> also directly
                    offers Surface Brightness. <i>Cartes du Ciel</i> is freeware planetarium software that provides distributions for
                    Linux, Mac, Raspberry Pi, as well as Windows. <b>Note</b>: I recommend using <i>SAC</i> settings, not <i>ONGC</i>.
                    Select <i>Setup -> Catalog</i> then click on the <i>CdC deep sky</i> tab. Click the radio button for <i>SAC</i>.
                    You will need to add 8.9 to SAC's <i>Surface Brightness</i> in order to convert it to the proper units.

                    <a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/c2a/english/index.htm" target="blank">Computer Aided Astronomy (C2A)</a> does not
                    offer Surface Brightness but it does give <i>Magnitude</i>, <i>Major Axis</i>, and <i>Minor Axis</i>. You can use
                    our built-in <i>Surface Brightness Calculator</i> to calculate it. <i>C2A</i> is freeware planetarium software however
                    it is only for Windows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Further Note</b>: All of the aforementioned sources offer <i>Magnitude</i>, <i>Major Axis</i>, and <i>Minor Axis</i>.
                    I recommend running those numbers through our <i>Surface Brightness Calculator</i> and then comparing it to the source's
                    value, if the source provides one. Sometimes they disagree. One option is to take the average but I will leave that up to
                    you to be optimistic or pessimistic. My only concern is that you will pass an opportunity because the integration time
                    looks too long. If the target is interesting it might be worthwhile to accept a lower SNR image than no image at all.

                <p>
                    Now to the definition of <i>Surface Brightness</i>. Visualize a galaxy. Its core is the brightest,
                    followed by the arms, and then the elusive galactic halo. Now, imagine squeezing all of those photons from all areas
                    into a tiny area the size of a single star. (Technically the size is 1 square arc-second.) How bright
                    would it be? Surprisingly bright. The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is <i>magnitude</i> 3.4 which would make it easily
                    visible from the center of most large cities but the fact of the matter is all of those photons are spread out over
                    a very large area, so because of that it is impossible to see M31 from New York City with the naked eye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the magnitude of M31 is 3.4 then what is its <i>Surface Brightness</i>? To answer that question we need to
                    know its dimensions. C2A lists it as 189.1 <i>arc-minutes</i> by 61.7 <i>arc-minutes</i>. Now let's plug those numbers into our
                    <i>Surface Brightness Calculator</i>. The answer is 22.2 <i>magnitudes per square arc-second</i>. Remember that this is the
                    <i>average</i> brightness over the entire area. Some parts will be brighter but overall it is a good
                    measure of how much effort it takes to obtain a world-class image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To explain why the Andromeda Galaxy is not visible without the aid of a telescope from New York City, consider that
                    the city's <i>Sky Brightness</i> is around 18 magnitudes per square arc-second. (We'll talk more about that in the
                    section on <i>Observatories</i>). Now compare 18 to 22.2. That makes the galaxy 4.2 magnitudes fainter than the sky.
                    I'm sorry but you are just not going to see it with the naked eye. You'll need a telescope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earlier I spoke of <i>Surface Brightness</i> determination as an art form. The problem is that different information
                    sources may give you significantly different values for magnitude, major axis, and minor axis depending on what
                    criteria they use. I have seen deviations of up to 2 magnitudes per square arc-second. This is huge. I recommend that
                    you choose a provider and stick with them. I've recommended three.

                    In case your information provider does not directly offer the value of <i>Surface Brightness</i> you can use this

                <p>
                    Magnitude is brightness measured on a logarithmic scale. Negative magnitude is very bright, the Sun is at -25 and the
                    Full Moon at -12. Sirius, the brightest star besides our Sun, is magnitude -1.6. At night in the suburbs the faintest
                    star you can see with the naked eye is around +5. With a small telescope and eyepiece you can see down to about +12.
                    With a small telescope and a camera you can capture stars down to +18. With a large telescope and camera in dark rural
                    skies you can see down to magnitude +25, give or take.

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    By convention the ellipse is used to model a target's shape. An ellipse can be described by two properties: major axis
                    and minor axis. It is similar in a way to a rectangle's width and height except that ellipses have curved edges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The units of measurement are angular, specifically arc-minutes. The Surface Brightness Calculator requires arc-minutes
                    so make sure that your information provider is giving you values in arc-minutes. Unless it is spelled out a single
                    apostrophe denotes arc-minutes whereas a double apostrophe, better known as quote marks, denotes arc-seconds. Galaxies
                    are almost always quoted in arc-minutes but a lot of planetary nebulae are in arc-seconds. Be sure to divide arc-seconds
                    by 60 in order to convert it to arc-minutes.

                    Telescopes come in all shapes and sizes but each falls into the category of either <i>Refractive</i> or <i>Reflective</i>.
                    Refractors use a lens as the primary light gathering element. Reflectors use a mirror.

                    There are four essential properties that describe a telescope. You can leave them empty and come back later to fill them in.
                    Just know that the <i>Calculate!</i> tool is less forgiving. It <b>must</b> know the value of each in order to proceed.

                    This is the diameter of the primary lens or mirror measured in millimeters(mm). For example my William Optics refractor's
                    aperture is 71mm. Other telescopes may be measured in inches. In those cases multiply inches by 25.4. It's best to refer
                    to the manufacturer's datasheet for the exact value.

                    Focal length is measured in millimeters(mm). Basically it is the distance between the primary lens or mirror and the focused
                    image. Be careful to factor in the effect of addtional refractive elements like a focal reducer or barlow lens. If you added
                    a 0.67x focal reducer then multiply 0.67 by the manufacturer's datasheet for focal length. For example if the manufacturer says
                    that the telescope's focal length is 616mm then you need to multiply it by 0.67 to get the <i>effective</i> focal length of
                    412.7mm.

                    Almost all reflectors have a central obstruction of one type or the other. Usually there is a small <i>secondary mirror</i>
                    that reflects the light 90 degrees to an opening in the telescope tube. Please refer to your manufacturer's datasheet for
                    the size of the central obstruction. Note that refractors do not have one but you still need to enter 0.

                    This is a measure of the total optical efficiency of the telescope. Values from 0 to 1 are acceptable. A value of 1 is
                    <i>ideal</i> but in reality there are always some losses. If you have multiple elements like a primary and secondary mirror
                    then you need to multiply them. For example if the primary mirror is 99% efficient and the secondary is 98% efficient then
                    calculate 0.99 times 0.98. You should enter the value of 0.97 in this field. I recommend not fretting over the exact value.
                    I use 0.99.

                    Pixel Size is measured in microns which is one-thousandth of a millimeter, abbreviated <i>um</i>. CMOS cameras generally have smaller
                    pixel sizes than do CCD cameras. 2 microns to 10 microns is not uncommon.

                    Many cameras have square pixels but some have rectangular ones. Our <i>Pixel Size</i> property assumes a square pixel. If yours is
                    rectangular, say for example 3um x 4um, then you need to run a simple calculation: <i>SQRT(width * height)</i>. So in our example you
                    will calculate <i>SQRT(3 * 4)</i> which is 3.464. That is the value you should enter.

                    and consequently the noise. In an ideal world our camera is unaffected by temperature but to get close to ideal we must cool the
                    sensor. Cameras that are designed for deep-sky astrophotography come with thermo-electric coolers that lower the sensor's
                    temperature by nearly 40 degrees Celsius. Dark current at that temperature is virtually zero. If your camera's manufacturer has
                    data on dark current then use it but if not feel free to enter zero in this field.

                    desireable Bortle 4 skies.

                    The Bortle class system ranks nighttime skies on a scale from 1 to 9. Bortle class 1 is the darkest possible site usually taken by
                    professional astronomers. Bortle class 9 is found in the heart of cities suffering from terrible light pollution.
                    The Bortle class field is for your information only. The <i>Calculate!</i> tool does not require it so you can leave it empty if

                    <i>Sky Brightness</i> is required. Bortle class and it are directly related. If you want to see how, you can visit the

                    if you happen to know your Bortle class. You can simply lookup the Sky Brightness and use it.

                <p>
                    If you don't know your Bortle class then you can use <a href="https://www.lightpollutionmap.info" target="_blank">this fine tool</a>
                    courtesy of <b>lightpollutionmap.info</b>. It supplies a world map that you can zoom and pan to find your observatory's location.
                    Once you have arrived click the tools icon, the one having the tooltip: "Toggle the extended toolbar". From there you can click
                    the cross icon. Doing that changes the mouse pointer from a finger to a cross. Place the cross on the desired location and then left-mouse
                    click. A window pops that displays some useful information. One such piece is your Bortle class and the other is <i>SQM</i> which
                    stands for Sky Quality Meter. SQM happens to have the same units of measurement as our required <i>Sky Brightness</i>. Jot that value down
                    and enter it into our web application's Sky Brightness field.

                <p>
                    You may have noticed that the units of <i>Sky Brightness</i> are the same as a Target's <i>Surface Brightness</i>: magnitudes

                <p>
                    <i>Targets</i>: <i>Surface Brightness</i> must be a number, either positive or negative.

                    <i>Telescopes</i>: <i>Aperture</i> and <i>Focal Length</i> must be numbers greater than zero. <i>Central Obstruction</i>
                    must be a number greater than or equal to zero. <i>Total Reflectance/Transmittance</i> must be a number between 0 and 1,
                    inclusive. <i>Central Obstruction</i> must be less than <i>Aperture</i>.

                    are very forgiving regarding empty fields which is nice when you are piecing together information,
                    however when you arrive at the <i>Calculate!</i> tool things get serious, necessarily.

                    The tool presents you with four dropdown lists labeled targets, telescopes, cameras, and observatories.
                    The first item in each list reminds you to "Choose one...". If you open a list and nothing more is shown then
                    you can not proceed to step 2.

                    This is useful in several ways. Firstly, you can clearly see what effect total time and exposure have on
                    the total signal-to-noise ratio. Secondly, in practice you might only have a two hour time window for imaging
                    tonight, and you want to know what signal-to-noise ratio you can expect to achieve.

                    This is huge. With experience you might discover that in order to achieve top-tier results that you need a
                    minimum total signal-to-noise ratio of, say, 25. The hard truth may be revealed that you need something on
                    the order of 20+ hours of total integration time which might take 5+ nights to achieve. Straight away you
                    can decide if this target is too faint for your site, so either skip this target or seek out darker skies.

                <p>
                    You need to treat stars differently from galaxies. There is a lot of dark space between stars
                    that will greatly skew the surface brightness calculation that you would normally do for a galaxy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When imaging star clusters the stars themselves are the topic and the focus of attention. With
                    galaxies however it is the galaxy that is important, so you can sacrifice surrounding stars to the
                    effects of saturation in order to achieve your goal.
                </p>
                <p></p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="subtitle is-5">The Technique</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    <b>Step 1</b>: Calculate the dynamic range of your camera. There is a formula for this:
                    <i>2.5 * LOG10(Full Well Depth / Read Noise)</i>. For example the Full Well Depth (FWD) of my
                    camera is 13400 electrons and the Read Noise is 5.3 electrons. Therefore the dynamic range is
                    8.5 magnitudes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Step 2</b>: Use planetarium software to find the magnitude of the brightest star in the
                    cluster. For example lets say it is magnitude 7.5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Step 3</b>: Add the dynamic range of your camera and the magnitude of the brightest star.
                    In our example it is 8.5 + 7.5 = 16.0
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Step 4</b>: Decide what type of seeing conditions you typically have at your observatory.
                    At my home site the seeing conditions are typically poor so I use a value of 4.5 arc-seconds.
                    If you are blessed with Good seeing then use 1.5 arc-seconds. For OK seeing use 3 arc-seconds.
                    It is best to be conservative when choosing a number. If you base your calculations on Poor seeing
                    but get a night of better seeing conditions then you will end up with a higher quality image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Step 5</b>: Calculate the surface brightness of the faintest star given your seeing conditions.
                    Remember what we are trying to achieve: we want to take advantage of the full dynamic range of our
                    camera. Our example is a magnitude 16.0 star which is the faintest we can detect while not saturating
                    the brightest stars in the cluster. Your particular situation will vary. To do this, go to the Targets
                    editor and create a new Target. Give it the name "Magnitude 16.0 star (Poor seeing)". Next open the
                    Surface Brightness Calculator by clicking the SHOW CALCULATOR button. Type "16" into the Magnitude
                    input control. Pull out your smartphone's calculator and divide your seeing conditions by 60. In my
                    case it is 4.5 arc-seconds / 60 which is 0.075 arc-minutes. Type "0.075" into both the Major and Minor
                    Axis input controls. The Surface Brightness Calculator says that the answer is 19.0 magnitudes per
                    square arc-second. Copy and paste that number into the Surface Brightness field of your Target and
                    then save it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Step 6</b>: At your telescope take some sample exposures of the cluster. Find the exposure
                    that puts the brightest star in the cluster just below the saturation point. (There are a number
                    of ways to measure the peak pixel value of a star depending on your capture software. I have the
                    choice of using FITS Viewer in KStars/Ekos, or I can use Siril, or FITS Liberator. Just be sure
                    that you are measuring the peak pixel of that specific star and not the entire frame.) At this
                    moment you might just want to start capturing frames while you proceed to the next step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Step 7</b>: Use the <i>Calculate!</i> tool to determine the total integration time and
                    number of frames needed to achieve a total signal-to-noise ratio of 40. Recently I captured
                    the beautiful dual star cluster M35 + NGC 2158 in Gemini. I discovered that I needed 15-second
                    exposures in order to keep the brightest stars from saturating. A couple hours later I had a high
                    quality, low noise stacked final image that clearly showed magnitude 16.0 stars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's it!
